a box and whiskers calculator and html5 canvas graph. Seems like there isn't a single accurate box and whiskers calc out there, so I made one. The canvas graph could be fixed up a bit, for example, moving the numeric labels around depending on the length of the number (amount of digits) etc, but it works well enough.
